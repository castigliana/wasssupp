        deeper your rest, the more dynamic your activity is.

        There is a connection between the breath and emotions


        Have you noticed how you breath when you are angry or sad?


        There is a two way street. Through breath you can influence how you
        feel, your mind


        We use only 30% of lung capacity


        90% of nutrition comes from breath


        90% of toxins are eliminated through breath

        SKY Breath can help reduce the level of sugar in the blood, along with
        lowering blood pressure, and reducing the symptoms.


        Practicing daily SKY Breath  Meditation can help reduce stress in the
        mind and body. This, in turn, reduces glucagons and can also help
        improve insulin action.
